# Contributing to PatchPanel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PatchPanel! We welcome contributions from
the community as they are essential for the project's continued growth and development.

## Important Note on Resources

PatchPanel is maintained with limited development resources.
**Community contributions directly impact the pace of feature development and bug fixes.**

The more the community contributes, the faster the project can grow and improve.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the appropriate issue template** (bug report, feature request, etc.)
3. **Provide detailed information** to help us understand and prioritize the issue
4. **Include system information** (Debian/Ubuntu version or Home Assistant addon version, Node.js version, HAProxy version, etc.)

### Submitting Pull Requests

We appreciate all pull requests! To ensure smooth collaboration:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your feature branch from `main`
2. **Follow the existing code style** and patterns
3. **Add tests** for new functionality when possible
4. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the API or configuration
5. **Write clear commit messages** describing your changes
6. **Fill out the pull request template** completely

### Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `packaging/config/production-config.yaml` to `dev.config.yaml` at the repo root and adjust paths for local testing
   (the loader prefers `dev.config.yaml` when present, so production config is untouched)
4. Run in development mode: `npm run dev`
5. Access the management UI and API at `http://localhost:8099` (configurable in `dev.config.yaml`);
   the API documentation lives at `/api-docs` once Swagger UI is wired up.

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow existing JavaScript/Node.js conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic appropriately
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Keep functions focused and modular

### What We're Looking For

**High Impact Contributions:**

- Bug fixes (especially those affecting system stability)
- Security improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements

**Feature Contributions:**

- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- API improvements
- Better error handling
- Integration improvements

## Response Times and Review Process

Due to limited development resources:

- **Issue responses**: We aim to acknowledge new issues within a few days
- **Pull request reviews**: Reviews may take weeks depending on complexity and current workload
- **Feature requests**: Prioritized based on community needs and available resources
- **Documentation updates**: Generally reviewed quickly as they're high-impact, low-risk

## Getting Help

If you need help with contributing:

- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions about development
- **Issues**: Use the "question" template for specific inquiries
- **Documentation**: Check our [comprehensive documentation](https://patchpanel.startcloud.com/)
